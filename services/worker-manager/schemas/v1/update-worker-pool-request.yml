title: Worker Pool Definition
description: |
  Fields that are defined by a user for a worker pool.
  Used to modify worker-pool definitions.

  The `workerPoolId`, `created`, and `lastModified` fields are optional and
  allowed only to ease the common practice of getting a worker pool definition
  with `workerPool(..)`, modifying it, and writing it back with
  `updateWorkerPool(..).  `workerPoolId` must be correct if
  supplied, and the values of `created` and `lastModified` are ignored.
